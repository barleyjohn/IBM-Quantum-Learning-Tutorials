    "Background\n",
    "The Qiskit AI-powered transpiler service (QTS) introduces machine learning-based optimizations in both routing and synthesis passes. These AI modes have been designed to tackle the limitations of traditional transpilation, particularly for large-scale circuits and complex hardware topologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features of the AI-Powered Transpiler:\n",
    "\n",
    "Routing Passes: AI-powered routing can dynamically adjust qubit paths based on the specific circuit and backend, reducing the need for excessive SWAP gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "AIRouting : Layout selection and circuit routing\n",
    "Synthesis Passes: AI techniques optimize the decomposition of multi-qubit gates, minimizing the number of 2-qubit gates, which are typically more error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "AICliffordSynthesis : Clifford gate synthesis\n",
    "AILinearFunctionSynthesis : Linear function circuit synthesis\n",
    "AIPermutationSynthesis : Permutation circuit synthesis\n",
    "AIPauliNetworkSynthesis : Pauli Network circuit synthesis (only available in the Qiskit Transpiler Service, not in local environment)\n",
    "Comparison with Traditional Transpilation: The standard Qiskit transpiler is a robust tool that can handle a broad spectrum of quantum circuits effectively. However, when circuits grow larger in scale or hardware configurations become more complex, the Qiskit AI-powered transpiler service (QTS) can deliver additional optimization gains. By leveraging learned models for routing and synthesis, QTS further refines circuit layouts and reduces overhead for challenging or large-scale quantum tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will evaluate the AI modes using both routing and synthesis passes, comparing the results to traditional transpilation to highlight where AI offers performance gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on the details of QTS, please refer to the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Use AI for Quantum Circuit Transpilation?\n",
    "As quantum circuits grow in size and complexity, traditional transpilation methods struggle to optimize layouts and reduce gate counts efficiently. Larger circuits, particularly those involving hundreds of qubits, impose significant challenges on routing and synthesis due to device constraints, limited connectivity, and qubit error rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where AI-powered transpilation offers a potential solution. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the AI-powered transpiler in Qiskit can make smarter decisions about qubit routing and gate synthesis, leading to better optimization of large-scale quantum circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Brief Benchmarking Results\n",
    "(https://learning-api.quantum.ibm.com/assets/02aeb9a6-0a19-45e8-8b47-85d477a6ec1f?format=auto&quality=80)\n",
    "In benchmarking tests, the Qiskit AI-powered transpiler service (QTS) consistently produced shallower, higher-quality circuits compared to the standard Qiskit transpiler. For these tests, we used Qiskit’s default pass manager strategy—configured via the \n",
    "generate_preset_passmanager\n",
    ". While this default strategy is often effective, it can struggle with larger or more complex circuits. By contrast, QTS’s AI-powered passes achieved an average 24% reduction in 2-qubit gate counts and a 36% reduction in circuit depth for large circuits (100+ qubits) when transpiling to the heavy hex topology of IBM Quantum hardware. For more information on these benchmarks, please refer to the following blog post [1].\n",

    "When should users choose AI-powered transpilation?\n",
    "The AI-powered transpiler in Qiskit excels in scenarios where traditional transpilation methods struggle—particularly with large-scale and complex quantum circuits. For circuits involving hundreds of qubits or those targeting hardware with intricate coupling maps, the AI transpiler offers superior optimization in terms of circuit depth, gate count, and runtime efficiency. In benchmarking tests, it has consistently outperformed traditional methods, delivering significantly shallower circuits and reducing gate counts, which are critical for enhancing performance and mitigating noise on real quantum hardware.\n",

    "Users should consider AI-powered transpilation when working with:\n",

    "Large circuits where traditional methods fail to efficiently handle the scale.\n",
    "Complex hardware topologies where device connectivity and routing challenges arise.\n",
    "Performance-sensitive applications where reducing circuit depth and improving fidelity are paramount.\n",
    "Getting the Best Results: Using ai=\"auto\"\n",
    "For optimal results, users can set ai=\"auto\" in the Qiskit Transpiler Service. This automatically selects the best AI-based optimizations based on the circuit and target hardware, ensuring that the transpiler delivers the highest performance without manual configuration. This mode is ideal for users who want the convenience of automatic optimization while still benefiting from the powerful AI-driven enhancements to circuit routing and synthesis.\n",

    "Permutation networks are foundational in quantum computing, particularly for systems constrained by restricted topologies. These networks facilitate long-range interactions by dynamically swapping qubits to mimic all-to-all connectivity on hardware with limited connectivity. Such transformations are essential for implementing complex quantum algorithms on near-term devices, where interactions often span beyond nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we highlight the synthesis of permutation networks as a compelling use case for the AI-powered transpiler in Qiskit. Specifically, the AIPermutationSynthesis pass leverages AI-driven optimization to generate efficient circuits for qubit permutation tasks. By contrast, generic synthesis approaches often struggle to balance gate count and circuit depth, especially in scenarios with dense qubit interactions or when attempting to achieve full connectivity.\n",
